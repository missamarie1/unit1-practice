    <h2 id="mystart">How I got my start.</h2>
    <p>I became intersted in coding because in August 2021 my dad and I were upnorth and he sat me down and told me how I needed to work smarter not harder, and that he regretted working on his feet all these years and ruining his body and just wanted me to realize how hard it was going to be to ruin my body and still work multiple jobs to make a living. After that I was thinking about what I could do that I actually enjoyed but also would be able to make money at. I remembered taking a web design class in high school and loving it and decided to look back into it. Then I started watching youtube videos and doing free online classes to see how I liked it and ended up loving it!</p>
<p>I ended going through many different online bootcamps and different schools to choose from, there are so many out there. I did research constantly, asked many people's opinions, and watched youtube videos explaining why people chose what bootcamp. I narrowed it down to Grand Circus and Michigan State's Bootcamp. I loved both and was very conflicted on which one to choose but ended up choosing Grand Circus in the end because of the financial support I was able to get and am so happy with my choice. </p>
